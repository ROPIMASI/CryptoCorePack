### Project's main objectives
The objective of this project is to implement a package of Java classes with symmetric and asymmetric cryptography features applicable to plain text values and  plain text files. The package should be implemented in such a way that it can be distributed and imported by projects that wish to use it. First CryptoCorePack must be able to respond by itself to the interactivity of the Command-Line-Interface, then to be importable to other desktop or server projects and, later, integrable with Web-Services projects.
