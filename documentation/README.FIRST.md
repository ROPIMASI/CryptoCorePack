# / documentation / README FIRST

##### A preliminary note
Namely: CryptoCorePack is monitored under the project-template "Automated Kanban with reviews" on GitHub, and managed under influence of "SCRUM", therefore the project has "backlog" and, the project's development time-line is also guided by "Gitflow", so it has some branches such as "master", "develop", "release", "feature/xyz", "bugfix", "hotfix". See more about the GitHub Kanban panel of the [CryptoCorePack's project in its own page](https://github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/9), and see more about its [branches and time-line evolution in its own repository](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack). For a better reading know the table of [acronyms and abbreviations](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack/tree/master/documentation/acronyms-abbreviations.txt).

# CryptoCorePack
Cryptogrphy Core Package Project - `README.md (v5)`  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
#### The CryptoCorePack and its resources are a personal project sample, which had been developed to demonstrate some of Author' skills:
- OOP;
- JAVA;
- KANBAN;
- GIT;
- GITHUB;
- GITFLOW.  
  
The **CryptoCorePack** project belongs to author's portfolio. The detailed project can be followed on his GitHub Projects List: [github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/](https://github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/). It is also found on author's web-portfolio: [ronaldomarques.dev](https://www.ronaldomarques.dev).

## Description
 - SUBJECT: Plain text symmetric and asymmetric cryptography package;
 - PROJECT NAME: Cryptography Core Package Project;
 - PROJECT ALIAS: CryptoCorePack.    
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
<a name="project-objective"></a>
## Project's objective
The objective of this project is to implement a package of Java classes with symmetric and asymmetric cryptography features applicable to plain text values and  plain text files. The package should be implemented in such a way that it can be distributed and imported by others projects. First, CryptoCorePack must be able to respond by itself to the interactivity of the Command-Line-Interface (CLI), after, should be importable to other desktop or server projects, and then, integrable with Web-Services projects.  
  
CryptoCorePack's **first goal** is to release a MVP (minimum viable product), a version which has no all features projected, but has the main ones.  
  
CryptoCorePack's **second goal** is to release the first full stable version which has its full description, such as features, options, and to-do-list, found in the [project's documentation](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack/tree/master/documentation/readme.first.md).

## Versions
On a team project, is very important to know and to follow the project's versioning specifications. Although at the moment CryptoCorePack's status is under early development because it has not its first stable version released yet (1.0.0-stable), and it is being developed privately (without community cooperation), it already is designed under [**SemVer** (Semantic Versioning Specification)](http://semver.org/). Maybe it will become a team project in the future.  
  
Thus, CryptoCorePack uses **_SemVer_** for its versioning. **SemVer** is a specification (set of rules) that tells(or dictates) us how to use the numbers (and some letters) on the _versioning-expression_. More specifically, CriptoCorePack uses _Major.Minor.Patch-PreReleaseStatus+Build_. Even it seems to be too long, but who getting involved with the project can notice that it is not, since the numbers and words used on _versioning-expression_ are small, and more importantly, the two last flags (PreReleaseStatus and Build) are optional. Examples: **0.1.0-_beta_**, **1.0.0-stable+20201005**.  
  
The standard flags of _PreReleaseStatus_ for the _versioning-expression_ are as follows:
 - **_dev_**: in early development, not encouraged usage;
 - **_alpha_**: in development, first test phase, it's encouraged usage for **test only** by people involved with software development, at self-own risk;
 - **_beta_**: in pre-release version, general public usage is acceptable, however, only for test, usage is a choice at self-own risk;
 - **_stable_**: stable tested release version; bugs are possible to appear, so it would come back to a _hotfix-branch_ if needed.  
  
#### Last Versions: 0.1.0-dev+20191130;
  
#### Current Versions: 0.1.0-dev+20200428;
  
#### Next Versions: 0.1.0-alpha;
  
A detailed description of each past and current version and, the milestones for the future versions can be found in the [project's documentation](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack/tree/master/documentation).
