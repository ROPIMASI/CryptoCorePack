# PRESENTATION: "0.1.0-backlog.txt" (v1)
This document is the official CryptoCorePack Project's backlog documentation for the project version '0.1.0-beta'. This includes a features list as a target to be reached, then once the target is reached and merged to 'release' branch the label "0.1.0-beta" is assigned to it. The backlog content is added by the project's author only, based on analysis of 'goals-objectives.txt'. Maybe in the future this document (M.n.p-backlog.txt) can be filled by contributors, through the results of sequence of virtual events: round-table, debate, and convention, in that order.  
  
  
  
##### A preliminary note
Namely: CryptoCorePack is monitored under the project-template "Automated Kanban with reviews" on GitHub, and managed under influence of "SCRUM", therefore the project has "backlog" and, the project's development time-line is also guided by "Gitflow", so it has some branches such as "master", "develop", "release", "feature/xyz", "bugfix", "hotfix". See more about the GitHub Kanban panel of the [CryptoCorePack's project in its own page](https://github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/9), and see more about its [branches and time-line evolution in its own repository](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack). For a better reading know the table of [acronyms and abbreviations](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack/tree/master/documentation/acronyms-abbreviations.txt).
