#### The CryptoCorePack and its resources are a personal proprietary project sample, which had been developed to demonstrate some of Author' skills:
 - JAVA;
 - OOP;
 - KANBAN;
 - GIT;
 - GITHUB;
 - GITFLOW.  
  
The **CryptoCorePack** project belongs to author's portfolio and, the detailed project can be followed on his GitHub-Projects: [github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/](https://github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/). It is also found on author's web-portfolio: [ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio](https://ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio).

## Project's objective
The objective of this project is to implement a package of Java classes with symmetric and asymmetric cryptography features applicable to plain text values and  plain text files. The package should be implemented in such a way that it can be distributed and imported by projects that wish to use it. First CryptoCorePack must be able to respond by itself to the interactivity of the Command-Line-Interface, then to be importable to other desktop or server projects and, later, integrable with Web-Services projects.

## Versions
On a team project, is very important to know and to follow the project's versioning specifications. Although at the moment CryptoCorePack's status is under early development because it has not its first stable version released yet (1.0.0-stable), and it is being developed privately (without community cooperation), it already is designed under **_SemVer_**. Maybe it will become a team project in the future.  
  
Thus, CryptoCorePack uses [**SemVer** (Semantic Versioning Specification)](http://semver.org/) for its versioning. **SemVer** is a specification (set of rules) that tells(or dictates) us how to use the numbers (and some letters) on the _versioning-expression_. More specifically, CriptoCorePack uses _Major.Minor.Patch-PreReleaseStatus+Build_. Even it seems to be too long, but who getting involved with the project can notice that it is not, since the numbers and words used on _versioning-expression_ are small, and more importantly, the two last flags (PreReleaseStatus and Build) are optional.  
  
CryptoCorePack's **first goal** is to release a MVP-stage (minimum viable product) version **0.1.0-_beta_** which has no all features projected, but has the mainly ones.  
  
CryptoCorePack's **second goal** is to release the first full stable version **1.0.0-stable** which has its full description, such as features, options, and to-do-list in the [project's documentation](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack/tree/master/documentation).  
  
The standard flags of _PreReleaseStatus_ for the _versioning-expression_ are as follows:
 - **_dev_**: in early development, not encouraged usage;
 - **_alpha_**: in development, first test fase, encouraged usage for test only at self own risk;
 - **_beta_**: release version, however only for test, usage is a choose at self own risk;
 - **_stable_**: stable tested release version; bugs are possible to appear, so would come back to a _hotfix-branch_ if needed. 
  
#### Last Versions: 0.1.0-dev+20191130;
#### Current Versions: 0.1.0-dev+20200428;
