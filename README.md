#### The CryptoCorePack and its resources are a personal property project sample, which I have developing to demonstrate some of my abilities.
The **CryptoCorePack** project belongs to my personal portfolio. Its detailed project can be followed just here on GitHub: [github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/](https://github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/). It is also found on my web portfolio: [ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio](https://ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio).

## Versions
On a team project, is very important to know and to follow the project's versioning specifications. Although at the moment CryptoCorePack's status is under early development because it has not its first stable version released yet (1.0.0-stable), and it is being developed privately (without community cooperation), it already is designed under **_SemVer_**. Maybe it will become a team project.  
  
Thus, CryptoCorePack uses [**SemVer** (Semantic Versioning Specification)](http://semver.org/) for its versioning. **SemVer** is a specification (set of rules) that tells(or dictates) us how to use the numbers (and some letters) on the versioning expression. More specifically, CriptoCorePack uses *Major.Minor.Patch-PreReleaseStatus+Build*, it seems to be too long, but who getting involved with the project can notice that it is not, since the numbers and words used on versioning expression are small, and more importantly, the two last flags (PreReleaseStatus and Build) are optional.  
  
CryptoCorePack's first goal is to release the first stable version **1.0.0-stable** which has its full description in the project's documentation. Its standard flags for versioning expression are as follows:
- **_dev_**: in early development, not encouraged usage;
- **_alpha_**: in development, first test fase, encouraged usage for test only at self own risk;
- **_beta_**: release version, however only for test, usage is a choose at self own risk;
- **_stable_**: stable tested release version, bugs are possible to come back in a _hotfix-branch_.
